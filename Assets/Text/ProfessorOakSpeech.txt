Hello, there! Glad to meet you!
Welcome to the world of POKEMON!
My name is OAK.
People affectionately refer to me as the POKEMON PROFESSOR.
This world...
...is inhabited far and wide by creatures called POKEMON.
For some people, POKEMON are pets.  Others use them for battling.
As for myself...
I study POKEMON as a profession.
But first, tell me a little about yourself.
Now tell me.  Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?
Oh, you're neither? You're a robot? 
Right...So your name is TASHA.
This is my grandson.
He's been your rival since you both were babies.
...Erm, what was his name now?
...Er, was it SAMI?
That's right! I remember now! His name is SAMI!
TASHA!
Your very own POKEMON legend is about to unfold!
A world of dreams and adventures with POKEMON awaits!  Let's go!
