Good morning sleepy Robot!
Are you off on your adventure out west? 
Make sure you go see Christopher at Profesor Oaks lab!

Yay, it's my big sister Tasha!
I'm going to miss you when you go on your adventure!

Make sure you visit Profesor Oaks lab!
It's not safe to leave until you do. 

Greetings Tasha!
I have selected some of my best, and your favorite pokemon
for you to take on your adventure!
Check your pokemon by pressing Y! 
Good luck beating Sami, he's one of the best gym trainers!

Typical Saul! Standing around and not working.

Samera asleep and Hobgoblin running in circles, how typical! 

Sami is at Professor Oaks Lab! 

I love pokemon!

Oh god, a pretty girl, don't look! don't look! 

Oh, it's Tasha!  Maybe we can hang out after your adventure!?

Tasha is such a social butterfly! 

Jolie wants to be just like her Aunt Tasha when she grows up!
She's so full of energy, must be the Dalek dress.

Can you believe this Saul guy?  So lazy! Everyday, it's the same old thing! 
If there was an Acheivement for slacking off he'd have it!

I can heal your Pokemon for you. 

I'm sorry, the upstairs is closed.  
Someone brought their cat in, and he went crazy! 
He climbed up the walls, attacked the nurse and urinated everywhere! 

That old couple looks really worried about their cat!
One can only hope that Tasha and Sami can make up after the battle and be together that long. 

Allons-y! 

SONTAR-HA!  SONTAR-HA!

I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!

It's LeviOsa, not LeviosA! 

Why spiders? Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?

Welcome to the pokemart Tasha!
We have your order of Icy Hot and Jammie Dodgers ready for you! 

Hey cat!  
HEY CAT!  
* hiss * !
